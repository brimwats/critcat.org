## Glossary
**CritCat** is short for “critical cataloging,” a movement of cultural heritage workers who work to bring social justice, radical empathy, and outreach work into their everyday practice. Recognizing the need for information maintenence and care, critical catalogers read cataloging and classification systems with an eye for catalogic warrant, reflecting on the potential harm or benefit of each term on the catalog, users, and the library community as a whole. Critical catalogers understand the catalog in a “holistic manner,” and see systems like the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) or Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) as living documents that can be revised and improved.
