This resource would not exist if it were not for the following individuals, resources, and communities, who I am very grateful to/wards:

The folks that I am the most indebeted to are those who introduced me to these conversations:

- **[Emily Drabinski](http://www.emilydrabinski.com/)**, whose article [Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/669547) initally introduced me to this work and ideas.
  - Emily's article on [Teaching the Radical Catalog](http://www.emilydrabinski.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/drabinski_radcat.pdf) is a fantastic resource.

- **Deidre Thompson** and **Treshani Perera**'s [webinar: incorporating critical cataloging into your work](https://www.wehere.space/shop/p/cs004-101-incorporating-critical-cataloging-into-your-work-social-justice-initiatives-series-sknh5). Treshani also compiled the first version of critlib's critical cataloging bibliography (see below).

Other (re)sources found along the way:

- **[Violet B\. Fox](http://violetbfox.info)** was and is responsible for a great deal of work, resources, and community-bulding, especially on twitter @ #critcat. I am indebeted towards her work and resources, of which this is a small selection (see more in the Zotero database)
  - The [Cataloging Lab](https://cataloginglab.org/) is a vital source of information and collaboration.
  - The [critcat | critlib](http://critlib.org/critcat/) resource guide initially compiled by Treshani Perera and updated by Violet B. Fox, is intended to be "a valuable starting point to learn more about the ethics of library cataloging and classification. I was unaware of this resouce when this site was created and am thankful to Violet for pointing it out.
