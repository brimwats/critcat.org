# Zotero Database
It is **highly recommended** that you use  [the Zotero\.org version\,](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2649517/equitable_knowledge_organization/library) as that has better formatting and includes sorting options. If that is not an option, there is an automatically-generated list below.

The main library is divided up into 16 categories/subfolders based on the type of critique or focus they offer. Individual articles can & do belong to multiple categories. All tags on articles are automatically generated and do not reflect the author's view. A tag cleanup is a planned improvement on the database, but it involves more work than is possible right nowâ€”volunteers welcomed!

## Categories
- **_ToEval**: A folder of material that has not yet been evaluated for inclusion in one of the below categories.
- **Broad/Multiple Critiques**: Articles that offer multiple critiques of library cataloging/classification/metadata schemes. Often focused on LCC, LSCH, or DDC. 
- **Case Studies**: The newest category; meant to serve as a repository for case studies 
- **Disability**: Articles that take up disability as their central loci of focus
- **Equity Equality Ethics Social Justice Generally**: Articles that focus or claim to focus primarily on Ethics, Equality, Equity, or Social Justice. 
- **Gender & Sex**: Articles that focus specifically on Gender and (biological) Sex. I am considering combining this category with the Queer category below to make a Gender, Sex, and Sexuality category; feedback welcomed on this. 
- **Indigenous**: Articles that primarily take up First Nations, Aboriginal, Native American or other Indigenous topics.
